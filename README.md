# Numerical_Methods

#===========================

Here you can find some codes that perform different numerical simulations of physical phenomena (mostly easy ones, since I'm not a C++ expert).

To plot graphs and generate samples from generic distributions I use the libraries developed by ROOT CERN group, but in the codes where the ROOT is only use for graphs and cosmetics, you can just comment those lines.

EDIT: Many python programs have been added to this repository, although they are not extremely efficient (in particular the Lyapunov error one).
